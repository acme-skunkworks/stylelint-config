# triage-pr

Take a pull request from **draft + failing CI** to **merge-ready**, in two
phases, choosing the phase from the PR's draft state:

- **Phase A — while the PR is a draft:** inspect failing checks, pull GitHub
  Actions logs, and fix failures **in PR scope only**. Loop until CI is green or
  report blockers.
- **Phase B — after the PR is ready-for-review:** AI review is gated on
  `draft == false`, so once the PR is flipped to ready — by `promoteOnGreen` or a
  human — reviewers (Claude Code Review, Bugbot) post feedback. Fetch the
  **unresolved** findings, validate each
  against the codebase before changing anything, fix the valid ones, decline the
  invalid ones with technical reasoning, then loop back through Phase A.

This skill complements `/send-it` (which **opens** the draft PR). The draft→ready
flip is governed by a single control — `promoteOnGreen` in [`config.json`](config.json)
— and **an enabled config _is_ the authorisation** for it: when `promoteOnGreen` is
`true` (the default), human authorisation for the flip is **already acquired via the
repo config**, so after a cleanly-green Phase A the skill flips the PR to ready and
continues into Phase B without stopping to seek a separate sign-off (the ready-flip is
the gate that turns AI review on; see Step 6). The flip stays **guarded** — gated on
proven-green CI, **no unresolved human review threads**, and no unresolved base drift.
Set `promoteOnGreen: false` (or pass `--no-promote`) to opt out and stop at green; an
explicit user prompt — or the `--promote` / `--no-promote` flags — overrides the config
for that run. Merge to `main` is never automated; that stays a human action. See
[`references/review-discipline.md`](references/review-discipline.md) for the full
review-reception and verification rules folded into Phase B.

## Configuration

The knobs live in [`config.json`](config.json) beside this file. Read it at the
start of a run and use its values throughout. Edit your copied `config.json` to
match the consuming repo's review bots and (optionally) its Linear workspace.

The first four govern the **CI + review** loop:

| `reviewBots`     | GitHub login names whose comments and threads are treated as first-class AI review feedback. Matched against `author.login`; the `[bot]` suffix is normalised, so `claude` and `claude[bot]` both match (the GraphQL API returns the bare form). Edit to match your install — review-bot logins vary per repo. `github-actions` is deliberately excluded by default: it posts CI status and release-PR comments, not code review, so Phase B would otherwise action them as findings; add it only if your install genuinely posts review-type comments via the Actions bot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `["claude", "cursor", "coderabbitai"]` |
| `maxCiRounds`    | Maximum Phase-A re-watch iterations before stopping and reporting blockers. Bounds the fix-and-watch loop so it can't spin forever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `5`                                    |
| `replyOnAccept`  | Whether an **accepted** finding gets a factual thread reply referencing the fixing commit before the thread is resolved (the audit trail). `false` resolves accepted threads silently for maintainers who dislike bot-reply noise — declines always reply with reasoning regardless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `true`                                 |
| `promoteOnGreen` | The single control for the draft→ready flip. When `true`, after Phase A finishes with **every** required check genuinely green on a **draft** PR, run `gh pr ready <pr>` to flip it to ready-for-review (the gate that turns AI review on), then continue into Phase B — instead of stopping at green. **Default-on**, and an enabled config _is_ the human authorisation for the flip: proceed on proven green without seeking a separate sign-off. Set `false` (or pass `--no-promote`) to opt out and stop at green. Promotion is suppressed unless the green is _proven_ (Step 6's watched rollup, never "no failures yet"), there are **no unresolved human review threads**, and `mergeStateStatus` shows no unresolved base drift (`BEHIND` / `DIRTY`). An explicit user prompt — or `--promote` / `--no-promote` — overrides this per run; `--ci-only` and `--dry-run` never promote. | `true`                                 |

The remaining five configure the **follow-up capture** step (Step 10) — turning a
valid-but-out-of-scope finding into a tracked Linear issue. They are **opt-in**:
when `linearTeamName` is empty, capture is disabled and the step is skipped
silently (no Linear MCP calls). Capture also needs the Linear MCP server; skip it
silently when it is unavailable.

| Key               | Meaning                                                                                                                                                         | Default     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `linearTeamName`  | Linear team **name** (not the key — the key is renamed over time, the name is stable) the follow-up issues are created under. Empty disables capture entirely.  | `""`        |
| `issueKeys`       | Team-key prefixes that may appear in branch names, used to recognise issue ids the same way `linear-sync` does. Mirrors the established `issueKeys` convention. | `[]`        |
| `followUpLabel`   | Optional label applied to each created follow-up issue (e.g. `follow-up`). Empty = no label.                                                                    | `""`        |
| `followUpProject` | Optional Linear project (name, id, or slug) the follow-up issues are filed under. Empty = no project.                                                           | `""`        |
| `followUpState`   | Optional initial workflow state (type, name, or id — e.g. `Backlog`) for created issues. Empty = the team's default state.                                      | `"Backlog"` |

Only the configured `reviewBots` are actioned in Phase B. Human review comments
are surfaced in the final report but never auto-actioned, replied to, or
resolved — leave those for the human.

## Usage modes

**Auto** — detect the current branch's PR and its phase, then run:

```bash
triage-pr
```

**Explicit PR** — operate on a specific PR by number or URL:

```bash
triage-pr 123
```

**CI only** — run Phase A and stop, even if the PR is ready:

```bash
triage-pr --ci-only
```

**Dry run** — report failing checks and unresolved findings and propose fixes,
but change nothing (no commits, no pushes, no thread replies):

```bash
triage-pr --dry-run
```

**Promote on green** — opt in to flipping the draft to ready once Phase A is cleanly
green (then continue into Phase B). Overrides `promoteOnGreen` for this run;
`--no-promote` forces the default stop-at-green:

```bash
triage-pr --promote
```

## Process

### Step 1 — Locate the PR and detect the phase

```bash
gh pr view <pr> --json number,isDraft,state,headRefName,baseRefName,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
```

- Resolve the PR from the argument, or from the current branch when none is
  given. If `gh pr view` finds no PR, stop and tell the user to open one with
  `/send-it` first.
- `isDraft == true` → **Phase A**. When CI is green, promotion (`promoteOnGreen`,
  default on) flips the cleanly-green draft to ready at Step 6 and the run continues
  into Phase B. With promotion disabled (`--no-promote` / `promoteOnGreen: false`),
  report and stop instead — AI review has not run yet, and the skill leaves the flip
  to the human.
- `isDraft == false` → **Phase A** (confirm/clear CI), then **Phase B**.
- Record `baseRefName` for the drift checks and `mergeStateStatus` for conflict
  detection.

### Step 2 — Phase A: inspect failing checks

```bash
gh pr checks <pr>
```

For each failed Actions check, resolve its run ID from the check's `detailsUrl`
(in `statusCheckRollup`) and read the failing step's logs:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

Capture the **actual failing command and error lines**, not just the check name.
You are diagnosing a root cause, not pattern-matching a label.

### Step 3 — Phase A: classify each failure (in-scope vs upstream)

```bash
git fetch origin <base>
git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD   # files this PR actually touches
```

- **In-scope** — the failure names files in this PR's diff, or is a lint / test /
  build failure reproducible on the branch head. Fix it (Step 4).
- **Upstream / base drift** — the job also fails on `origin/<base>` independent of
  this diff, **or** `mergeStateStatus == BEHIND`, **or** the error names files the
  PR never touched. Remedy is to rebase/merge the base (Step 5), **not** to edit
  the failing code.
- A failure that can only be "fixed" by weakening a gate is never in-scope — see
  **Important rules**.

### Step 4 — Phase A: fix in-scope failures, one at a time

- Apply the smallest fix that addresses the **root cause** within the PR's scope.
- Re-run the **specific** failing command locally and read its exit code before
  claiming it fixed (e.g. `pnpm lint`,
  `npx skills-ref validate ./skills/<name>`, the failing test). Evidence before
  claims — never assert a fix on "should" or "probably".
- Commit with a Conventional Commit subject, then push. One fix → one
  verification → next fix.

### Step 5 — Phase A: handle base-branch drift

Only when Step 3 classified the failure as upstream/behind:

```bash
git fetch origin <base>
git merge origin/<base>      # or rebase, per the repo's convention
```

- Clean merge → push and re-watch (Step 6).
- Conflict → go to **Merge conflicts** below.

### Step 6 — Phase A: re-watch CI until green or budget exhausted

```bash
gh pr checks <pr> --watch
```

- After each push, watch the rollup to completion. Still red → loop back to
  Step 2.
- **Bound the loop** by `maxCiRounds`. When exhausted, stop and report the
  remaining failures as blockers rather than looping forever.
- Green **and ready** → continue to Phase B.
- Green **and draft**, promotion **disabled** (`--no-promote` / `promoteOnGreen: false`)
  → report green and **stop**.
- Green **and draft**, promotion **enabled** (default, or `--promote`) → run
  the **promotion gate** before flipping. All three must hold:
  1. **Proven green** — the green is _this step's_ watched-rollup green (not pending /
     "no failures yet"); apply the same exit-code discipline Phase A already enforces,
     never greenwash to reach the flip.
  2. **No unresolved human threads** — run
     `node scripts/review-threads.mjs <pr> --bots "<config.reviewBots joined by commas>"`
     and require `humanThreads` empty. (On a draft, `unresolvedThreads` is empty
     anyway — AI review hasn't run — so this gate is specifically about humans who
     reviewed the draft.)
  3. **No unresolved base drift** — re-fetch `mergeStateStatus` **fresh** right before
     the flip (`gh pr view <pr> --json mergeStateStatus`), not the Step 1 snapshot: an
     intervening Phase A push can have changed it. Require it not `BEHIND` / `DIRTY`
     (Phase A's Step 5 resolves in-scope drift; if it persists, do **not** promote —
     report it as a blocker).

  All three pass → `gh pr ready <pr>`, report the flip, then **continue to Phase B**
  (Step 7). The ready-flip and Phase B's pushes re-fire CI + AI review, and the whole
  loop stays bounded by `maxCiRounds`. Any gate fails → **do not flip**; report green
  plus the specific reason it wasn't promoted, and stop. Under `--dry-run`, report
  that it _would_ promote (or why not) and flip nothing. Under `--ci-only`, never
  promote — stop at green regardless of the knob.

### Step 7 — Phase B: fetch unresolved review feedback

Run the bundled fetcher. Its path is **relative to this skill's own directory**
(the one holding this `SKILL.md` and `config.json`) — resolve it from there, not
from the consuming repo's root, or the run fails with `ENOENT`. The `--bots`
value is `config.reviewBots` joined by commas:

```bash
node scripts/review-threads.mjs <pr> --bots "claude,cursor,coderabbitai"
```

This fetcher is **read-only** (it only fetches and prints), so it has no
`--dry-run` flag — running it never changes anything. The write side is
`respond-threads.mjs` (Step 8), which is where `--dry-run` lives.

It prints minimal JSON with three groups:

- `unresolvedThreads` — inline review threads (`isResolved == false`) raised by a
  configured `reviewBot`, trimmed to `{threadId, path, line, isOutdated, author,
comments}`. This is the actionable set.
- `humanThreads` — the same shape, for unresolved threads **not** raised by a
  review bot. Surface these in the report for the human; do not auto-action them.
- `aiSummaryComments` — the sticky issue-level summary the review action posts via
  `track_progress` / `use_sticky_comment`. At most **one per review bot** is kept:
  the bot's first issue comment, upgraded to a later one carrying a sticky marker
  (walkthrough / `use_sticky_comment` / `track_progress` / "Summary by …") if the
  first had none — so an "I'll review" ack, command acknowledgements, and chatter
  don't masquerade as the headline review. Surface it **separately**: it is an
  issue comment, **not** a review thread, so it has no `isResolved` and never
  appears in `unresolvedThreads`. Missing it would mean missing the headline
  review.

Resolved threads are filtered out so the context stays small. Empty
`unresolvedThreads` **and** no AI summary → report "no actionable AI review
feedback" and skip to Step 12.

### Step 8 — Phase B: validate each finding before touching code

Apply the six-step reception (full rules in
[`references/review-discipline.md`](references/review-discipline.md)):

1. **READ** the finding in full — body plus the cited file and line.
2. **UNDERSTAND** what it claims and why; restate it for yourself.
3. **VERIFY** it against the actual codebase. Open the cited lines and confirm
   the issue is real and not already handled. Never trust the bot's framing.
4. **EVALUATE** — is it correct, in-scope, and not a YAGNI or architecture
   violation?
5. **RESPOND** symmetrically — every actioned thread ends **replied-to and
   resolved**, so nothing is resolved silently:
   - **Decline** → reply with concise **technical reasoning**, then resolve.
   - **Accept** → resolve only **after** the fix is pushed and its proving
     command passes (and, when the PR is ready, that fix's CI round is green —
     see Step 9), with a factual reply referencing the fixing commit
     (`Addressed in <sha>.`). When `replyOnAccept` is `false`, resolve without the
     reply.
   - **Outdated** (cited code is gone) → resolve without a reply.
   - **Defer** (the finding is **valid but out of scope** for this PR — a
     worthwhile follow-up, not a change to make here) → **do not** resolve it now.
     Set it aside as a follow-up **candidate**, recording
     `{title, rationale, threadId, path, line}`, and leave the thread unresolved.
     Candidates are captured as tracked Linear issues — **only on explicit human
     approval** — at Step 10, which then posts the defer reply and resolves the
     thread. Never create an issue here.

   No sycophancy ("You're absolutely right!", "Great point!") — state facts.

6. **IMPLEMENT** accepted findings one at a time (Step 9), then reply+resolve.

The bundled `respond-threads.mjs` is the write side (its path is **relative to
this skill's directory**, like `review-threads.mjs`). It builds the reply body
(carrying a hidden idempotency marker), honours `replyOnAccept`, and skips any
thread already bearing our marker, then runs the reply + resolve mutations. Pass
`--bots` (the same `config.reviewBots` list) so it classifies the thread's author
and **refuses to action a human thread** even if its id is passed by mistake. Add
`--dry-run` to preview without writing:

```bash
# accepted finding, after its fix is pushed and proven/green:
node scripts/respond-threads.mjs thread --thread <PRRT_id> --decision accept --sha <sha> --bots "claude,cursor,coderabbitai"
# declined finding:
node scripts/respond-threads.mjs thread --thread <PRRT_id> --decision decline --reason "<technical reasoning>" --bots "claude,cursor,coderabbitai"
# deferred finding, after Step 10 mints its follow-up ticket:
node scripts/respond-threads.mjs thread --thread <PRRT_id> --decision defer --reference <issue-id> --bots "claude,cursor,coderabbitai"
```

`respond-threads.mjs --help` prints the full subcommand/flag usage, and
`respond-threads.mjs --self-test` runs the bundled offline assertions (no
network, no `gh`) — a quick way to confirm the script is healthy after install.

Resolving uses GitHub's GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` — the only per-thread
programmatic resolve, idempotent on an already-resolved thread. Do **not** use the
bulk `@coderabbitai resolve`: it resolves _every_ CodeRabbit thread at once,
including declined or not-yet-handled ones (see
[`references/review-discipline.md`](references/review-discipline.md)).

### Step 9 — Phase B: apply accepted fixes, then re-run Phase A

- Implement each accepted finding on its own; after each, freshly run the proving
  command and read its output and exit code before claiming it works.
- Commit and push, then **return to Step 2** — a new push re-fires CI, and AI
  review re-fires too (the PR is ready), producing fresh threads and an updated
  sticky comment.
- **Resolve an accepted thread only once that fix's CI round is green** (Step 6),
  not optimistically on push — a fix that regresses in CI must not leave a
  resolved thread behind. Decline/outdated threads resolve immediately (no code
  rides on them).
- **Convergence.** Loop Phase B ↔ Phase A until CI is green **and** every bot
  thread is _handled_ — resolved-by-us (accept, post-CI-green), declined+resolved,
  a human thread (never auto-actioned), or **flagged as a follow-up candidate**
  (a recognised transient state — left unresolved on purpose, settled at Step 10) —
  with **no accepted fix still awaiting CI-green**. Because each push re-triggers
  review, the idempotency marker is what makes this terminate: already-handled
  threads are skipped on the next pass, so only genuinely new findings are
  actioned. The whole loop stays bounded by `maxCiRounds`.

### Step 10 — Phase B: capture out-of-scope findings as follow-up issues

Once the thread loop has converged, gather every follow-up **candidate** flagged
during Step 8 — both per-thread defers **and** issue-level findings judged
valid-but-out-of-scope. If there are none, skip to Step 11.

**Capture is opt-in and gated on explicit human approval — nothing is created
otherwise.** It is disabled when `config.linearTeamName` is empty or the Linear MCP
server is unavailable; in that case (and whenever the human declines below), fall
back without creating anything: **decline** each per-thread candidate with concise
technical reasoning (`out of scope; not tracked`) and resolve it, and map each
issue-level candidate as `out-of-scope` with **no** ticket in the Step 11 summary.

When capture is enabled, present **all** candidates as a single batch and ask once
for explicit approval (**default no** — mirrors `cleanup-repo`'s two-pass gate):

```text
Proposed follow-up issues (none created yet):
  1. Refactor fetch layer — thread on src/api.ts:42
  2. Add retry backoff — CodeRabbit summary
Create these 2 issues in Linear? [y/N]
```

On a single explicit **yes**, create one Linear issue per candidate with
`mcp__linear-server__save_issue` — resolve the team by **name** and the state by
**type**, never a stale key (the renamed-team gotcha; see
[`skills/linear-sync/SKILL.md`](../linear-sync/SKILL.md)):

- `team` = `config.linearTeamName`; `title` derived from the finding.
- `description` = the bot's rationale, a back-link to the PR **and** the specific
  thread/comment URL, and the originating `path:line` (literal newlines, British
  English).
- `links` = `[{ url: <PR url>, title: "Source PR" }]`.
- `labels` = `[config.followUpLabel]` when set; `project` = `config.followUpProject`
  when set; `state` = `config.followUpState` when set (else the team default).
  Use `list_issue_statuses` / `list_projects` to resolve a configured state/project
  and fail loudly on a typo rather than filing in the wrong place.

Then write each created issue's id/URL back:

- **Per-thread** candidate → post the defer reply and resolve via the `defer`
  decision:

  ```bash
  node scripts/respond-threads.mjs thread --thread <PRRT_id> --decision defer --reference <issue-id> --bots "claude,cursor,coderabbitai"
  ```

- **Issue-level** candidate → carry it into Step 11 as
  `{ "title": "…", "status": "out-of-scope", "reference": "<issue-id>" }`.

Under `--dry-run`, list the candidates that _would_ be proposed and create nothing.

### Step 11 — Phase B: acknowledge issue-level review comments

Findings that arrive as **issue-level comments** — Claude's whole-review comment,
CodeRabbit's sticky summary (`aiSummaryComments` from Step 7) — have no resolvable
per-finding thread, so the thread machinery above never touches them. Once the
thread loop has converged (and Step 10's capture has minted any follow-up tickets),
acknowledge them on the PR with **one consolidated comment** mapping each finding →
`accepted (<sha>)` / `declined (<reason>)` / `out-of-scope (<ticket>)`:

```bash
node scripts/respond-threads.mjs summary --pr <pr> --findings '[{"title":"…","status":"accepted","reference":"<sha>"}]'
```

It carries a hidden marker and is **upserted in place** — a re-run edits the same
comment rather than posting a duplicate. Acknowledge each issue-level finding only
once here (not per sub-point of a checklist review — that is noise). Skip this step
entirely when there were no issue-level findings to map.

### Step 12 — Report

Summarise:

- Checks fixed, each with the failing command it addressed.
- Findings accepted and fixed (with the resolving commit).
- Findings declined, each with the technical reasoning given.
- Follow-up issues created (each with its Linear id/URL), or candidates that were
  proposed and **declined** (so nothing was created).
- Issue-level findings acknowledged in the consolidated comment.
- Base merges/rebases performed.
- Remaining blockers (if `maxCiRounds` was exhausted).
- Final CI state, with the proving command's output.
- Any **human** review comments, surfaced for the human to handle.
- The PR's draft/ready state: when promotion fired, report the flip (draft → ready)
  and that Phase B then ran; otherwise a reminder that the state is unchanged — the
  human flips it (and, if promotion was enabled but a gate blocked it, the specific
  reason).

## Merge conflicts

- Resolve **only** when the resolution is unambiguous and within the PR's scope
  (e.g. both sides touched disjoint hunks, or this branch's intent clearly
  supersedes).
- **Abort and ask the human** when intent is ambiguous: both sides changed the
  same logical thing, the conflict reaches files outside the PR's scope, or
  resolving needs a product decision. Run `git merge --abort` and report the
  conflicting files.
- Never resolve a conflict by deleting the other side's work just to make it
  compile.

## Important rules

- **Never greenwash.** Never edit `.github/workflows/*`, disable or loosen a lint
  rule, delete or skip a test, or relax a CI threshold to make a check pass. Fix
  the code, or report the failure as a blocker.
- **In-scope only.** Fix what this PR's diff is responsible for; don't fix
  unrelated repo problems.
- **Validate before implementing.** Never apply a review suggestion without first
  verifying it against the codebase.
- **AI bots only.** Action only the configured `reviewBots`; surface human
  comments but leave them for the human.
- **No sycophancy.** Decline with technical reasoning, not flattery.
- **Evidence before claims.** Never say CI is green or a fix works without freshly
  running the proving command and reading its exit code.
- **Draft → ready is guarded, and on by default.** `promoteOnGreen` is the single
  control for the flip, and an enabled config _is_ the authorisation: with it on (the
  default) the skill flips the PR — **only** after a _proven_-green Phase A, with **no
  unresolved human threads** and no unresolved base drift — then continues into Phase B,
  without seeking a separate human sign-off. Set `promoteOnGreen: false` / pass
  `--no-promote` to stop at green; an explicit user prompt or `--promote` /
  `--no-promote` overrides the config per run. Never greenwash to reach the flip;
  `--ci-only` never promotes. Merge stays a human action.
- **Bounded loops.** Stop after `maxCiRounds` and escalate.

## Error handling

- `gh auth status` fails → stop and tell the user to run `gh auth login`.
- No PR for the branch → stop with "open one with `/send-it` first".
- `gh run view --log-failed` unavailable (logs expired or run purged) → report
  the failing check by name without guessing its cause; do not fabricate a fix.
- The review-thread fetcher exits non-zero (rate limit, permissions, GraphQL
  error) → report it and fall back to `gh pr view <pr> --json reviews,comments`.
  Never treat "couldn't fetch" as "no findings".
- A finding cites a file or line that no longer exists (outdated thread) → note it
  as outdated and resolve it without a code change (`--decision outdated`).
- `respond-threads.mjs` exits non-zero (reply or resolve mutation fails on
  permissions) → fall back to a manual `gh api graphql` reply with the reasoning
  rather than aborting; the marker convention still applies so a later run skips it.
- The consolidated `summary` upsert can't find prior comments (REST page cap, ~100)
  → it posts a fresh comment; harmless, just avoid hand-deleting the marker so the
  next run can find and edit it.
